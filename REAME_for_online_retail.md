## üßæ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and prepare the data for machine learning tasks like **customer segmentation** or **sales prediction**.  
The notebook demonstrates how to load, inspect, and summarize a large retail transaction dataset.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset is loaded from an Excel file: `online_retail_II.xlsx`, containing over **500,000 transaction records** with the following columns:

- `Invoice`: Invoice number (object)  
- `StockCode`: Product/item code (object)  
- `Description`: Product description (object)  
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased (integer)  
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of invoice (datetime)  
- `Price`: Unit price (float)  
- `Customer ID`: Customer identifier (float, may contain nulls)  
- `Country`: Country of customer (object)
