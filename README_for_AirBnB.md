📝 Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various features such as:
•	Property attributes
•	Amenities
•	Location
•	Host information
The project also provides visualizations and explores which factors most influence the price.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/Babbar-rules/Machine_Learning-projects.git
cd Machine_Learning-projects
Prepare the Dataset
Place your Airbnb CSV file (e.g., Airbnb_data - airbnb_data.csv) in the appropriate directory or update the notebook with your dataset location.
Install Dependencies
bash
CopyEdit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the Notebook
Open AirBnB_Price_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells in order.

🔁 Project Workflow
📥 Data Import & Inspection
•	Load data using pandas
•	Inspect data types, missing values, and value distributions
🧹 Data Cleaning
•	Handle outliers (IQR method)
•	Fill missing values:
o	Median for numeric columns
o	Mode for categorical/boolean columns
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualize correlations (heatmaps)
•	Use boxplots, scatterplots, and histograms to explore price and feature distributions
________________________________________
🧠 Feature Engineering
•	One-hot encoding: property_type, room_type, bed_type, cancellation_policy, city
•	Label encoding: host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified, instant_bookable
•	Amenities: Count total amenities per listing
•	Host Features:
o	Host response rate
o	Years of experience
o	Superhost status
•	Geolocation: Compute distance to city center for known cities
⚖️ Feature Scaling
•	Apply MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for normalization
🧪 Data Splitting
•	Split into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test
________________________________________
🤖 Model Development
•	Drop unnecessary columns
•	Fit your preferred regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
•	Evaluate using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R²
