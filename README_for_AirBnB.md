Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights
This project analyzes Airbnb listings data to predict prices and extract actionable insights using machine learning. The notebook provides a complete pipeline: data import, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices from various features such as property attributes, amenities, location, and host information. The project also visualizes and explores which factors most influence price.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Babbar-rules/Machine_Learning-projects.git
cd Machine_Learning-projects
Prepare the dataset:

Place your Airbnb CSV file (e.g., Airbnb_data - airbnb_data.csv) at the indicated path or update the notebook with your data location.
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook:

Open AirBnB_Price_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells in order.
Project Workflow
Data Import & Inspection

Load data using pandas.
Initial inspection: datatypes, missing values, and value distributions.
Data Cleaning

Handle outliers (IQR method).
Fill missing values: median (numeric), mode (categorical/boolean).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize correlations (heatmaps), boxplots, scatterplots, and price distribution histograms.
Feature Engineering

One-hot encoding for categorical variables (property type, room type, bed type, etc.).
Label encoding for binary columns.
Count number of amenities per listing.
Extract host response rate, host experience (years), and superhost status.
Calculate distance to city center for major cities.
Merge all engineered features into the main dataframe.
Feature Scaling

Apply MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler to normalize features.
Data Splitting

Split data into training, validation, and test sets (60/20/20 split).
Model Development

Drop unnecessary columns.
(Add your regression or ML model code here. The notebook is ready for model fitting and evaluation.)
Feature Engineering
Categorical Encoding: One-hot for property type, room type, bed type, cancellation policy, and city.
Binary Encoding: Label encoding for host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified, instant_bookable.
Amenities: Parse and count amenities per listing.
Host Features: Host response rate, years active, superhost status.
Geolocation: Compute distance to city center for known cities.
Model Development
The data is preprocessed and ready for ML modeling after feature engineering and scaling.
Splitting strategy: 60% training, 20% validation, 20% test.
(You can add algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., and evaluate results.)
